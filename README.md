Roberto's attempts at Advent of Code
===

To do list
---

All / Shared:
x make one project and have libraries in one node thingy
x get it in git(hub)

Many / Shared:
- try using readFile (asynchronous) and then a promise somewhere
- try using the object literal extensions somewhere
- use generators somewhere
- use the new map builtin
- need to use de-structuring

Specific:
- in main.js, try using a reduce instead of forEach
- also in main.js, would be interesting to compare lodash to Array.prototype
